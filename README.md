# Mini-Wordle
Mini Wordle is a simplified version of the popular Wordle puzzle game. The game challenges the player to guess a 4-letter word chosen by another player. The guesser has six attempts to find the correct word.After each guess, the game provides feedback for each letter:

Green – the letter is correct and in the right position

Yellow – the letter exists in the word but is in the wrong position

Red – the letter is not in the word

The game is implemented with a graphical interface using graphics.h, displaying the guesses, feedback colors, and messages for winning or losing.
